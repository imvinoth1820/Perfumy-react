# Perfumy React Project
Vercel link to view https://perfumy-react-iota.vercel.app/

This project serves as my initial exploration into basics React, where I transformed my existing HTML and CSS design into React components for learning purposes. The project focuses on creating a visually appealing presentation of a perfume collection without any added functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple components, each representing a specific section or feature of the Perfumy application. The transformation from static HTML/CSS to React components provides a foundational understanding of React's component-based architecture.

## Technologies Used

- React: The project is built using React, allowing for a modular and reusable component structure.
- CSS: Styles are applied using CSS to achieve a visually pleasing and responsive design.

## Notes

This project is solely for educational purposes, and no additional functionality has been implemented beyond the transformation of HTML/CSS into React components.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the codebase to enhance your understanding of React!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
